# Hackathon-2016-App
Hackathon 2016 project - 
develop an application for children with allergies that informs them if they can consume a specific product/food.
Scan bar-code of product and use API to get a list of ingredients. Based on child's allegies, the app will determine 
if the user can consume the product.
